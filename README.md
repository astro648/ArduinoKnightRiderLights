# ArduinoKnightRiderLights
Hi! Welcome to the README!
## What is this?
This is 2 versions of the so-called "Knight Rider" light code for Arduino. The ports are 4-13. The first program goes from the outside (4&13) to the inside (8&9) and then back out again over and over. The second goes from 4-13 and back to make a flashing light kind of "animation" repeatedly.
