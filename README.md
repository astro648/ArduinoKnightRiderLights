# ArduinoKnightRiderLights
Hi! Welcome to the README!
## What is this?
This is 2 versions of the so-called "Knight Rider" light code for Arduino. The ports are 4-13. The first program goes from 4-13 and then back to four to make a flashing light thing and the second one goes from outside (4&13) back to the inside (8&9) and then back out, etc.
